# Extracting Structured Data from LLMs with LangChain & Pydantic


Large Language Models (LLMs) are great at generating text, but working with plain text outputs can be limiting. What if we could extract structured data like lists, dictionaries, or even pandas DataFrames directly from LLM responses? This talk explores how LangChain and Pydantic can help achieve exactly that.
We will start by understanding the limitations of unstructured text and why structured extraction is valuable. Then, we will build data models using Pydantic’s BaseModel and see how LangChain’s output parser can transform LLM responses into reusable Python objects. Through live demo, we will extract structured data from LLM queries, convert it into analysis-ready formats, and integrate it with machine learning models.

By the end of the notebook , you will gain hands-on knowledge of how to:
•	Define structured data models with Pydantic
•	Use LangChain to extract lists, dictionaries, and DataFrames from LLMs
•	Automate text processing and integrate structured outputs into AI/ML workflows

This is ideal for data scientists, developers, and AI enthusiasts looking to streamline data extraction. A basic understanding of Python and LLMs is helpful but not mandatory.
